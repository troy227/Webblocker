This is a Website Blocker which was made in Python.

This script modifies the "hosts" file in System32 to block websites.

All you need to do is to add the name of the websites in the webs.txt file.

This script only modifies the 'hosts' file if the time is in Working Hours which cam be changed directly in the script.

There is also a wb.pyw script which can be made to run in the background in Windows using the Task Scheduler.
